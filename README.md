# BINK.js

BINK! is an experiment in musical documentation.

You have things like SoundCloud and ReverbNation and others that allow bands to post their stuff online.  Sometimes, though, as a musician, this isn't enough because you produce a bunch of different recordings with a bunch of different people and it becomes not so much about image or brand promotion as it is just having an archive that lets you see the Who, What, Where and When that happened in a particular recording.

Where is SoundCloud's feature that shows you what each musician played on this recording?  What if there was a set break?  Where were these recordings on SoundCloud made?  Can I see a map of that?  _What day_ exactly, was this recording finished on?  Let me see all the recordings that were created at a certain location. Anyway, BINK makes all of this easy and allows for easy sharing of recordings between musicians.  You make a recording, you post it to BINK and then you can easily share with your fellow musicians.

Searching also makes it quite easy to find out "what was that I thing I played last spring with those guys from college?" and so on.

## Developer Notes

This is a section where I will put notes about BINK that are useful for mostly for me later on when I look at it and can't remember what I was doing.
